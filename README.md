# Roll20 Dark Mode for DnD 3.5e

This is a Dark Mode for Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e currently in beta. 

To make it work disable default Roll20 dark mode if you have it on (which is currently broken in all possible ways)

## Q&A

### Do you plan to make the dark mode for otehr modules?
There are no current plans for that, I don't care about Roll20 enough, this was made just for me and my friends. I'm using Foundry for my campaign and I suggest you should too, but since our campaign has been going for long time now on Roll20 we are stuck with it :)

### Can I give suggestions / report bugs for this? 
Sure, use the Issues section for both. I might consider them, or not ¯&#92;_(ツ)_/¯

### Can I use your style for other modules?
Of couse, just make sure to respect the MIT licence

### Do you take pull requests?
I might but there is a low chance of that
